      What We Do
    </h2>
    <p>
        August 29, 1997 came and went. Nothing much happened. Michael Jackson turned forty. There was no Judgment Day. People went to work as they always do, laughed, complained, watched TV, made love. I wanted to run down the street yelling... to grab them all and say "Every day form this day is a gift. Use it well!" Instead I got drunk. That was thirty years ago. But the dark future which never came still exists for me, and it always will, like the traces of a dream lingering in the morning light. And the war against the machines goes on. Or, to be more precise, the war against those who build the wrong machines. John fights the war differently than it was foretold. Here, on the battlefield of the Senate, the weapons are common sense... and hope. The luxury of hope was given to me. Because if a machine can learn the value of human life... maybe we can too.
